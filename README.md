# Party-Survey
I have created a fully functional Party Survey with the following functions:

- radio buttons to select a choice for the user
- utilized the <style> class to add color, different fonts, and borders to various elements in the survey page
- positioned elements using margin & width properties to space elements evenly amongst each other
- leveraged <div> classes that gave certain attributes to various elements
